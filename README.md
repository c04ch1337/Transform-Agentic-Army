# Relevance AI - Reverse Engineering Project

A comprehensive study and reverse engineering effort to understand and replicate the architecture, design patterns, and implementation strategies behind [Relevance AI](https://relevance.ai/)'s Agent-as-a-Service platform.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Relevance AI is a no-code/low-code platform for creating multi-agent workflows that leverage various AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) and tools. This project aims to:

1. **Understand** the complete tech stack and architecture
2. **Document** design patterns and implementation strategies
3. **Build** a simplified clone to validate our understanding
4. **Learn** production-grade AI application development

## 🔍 Reverse Engineering Methodology

### 1. Passive Reconnaissance
- Inspect network traffic in DevTools
- Analyze JavaScript bundles and source maps
- Study their Python SDK on PyPI/GitHub
- Review job postings for tech stack clues

### 2. Active Analysis
- Use the product and observe behavior
- Inspect API responses and headers
- Analyze workflow execution patterns
- Study streaming implementations

### 3. Architectural Deduction
- Map user actions to system components
- Trace data flow through the stack
- Identify key design patterns
- Document integration points

## 📖 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+

### Setup (Coming Soon)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Install frontend dependencies
